1. A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function. You can
divide the code into separate functions and each function will perform a certain task. This is useful 
because having a function would mean that the tasks that are being assigned are carried out and are written with efficient
code in mind.

2. The contact functions are used to organize the code in the program. The 'contacts' and 'contacthelpers' holds 
the function definitions for the structs. If we need to use the code then we only have to include one or a few of the 
files, which is more efficient.
