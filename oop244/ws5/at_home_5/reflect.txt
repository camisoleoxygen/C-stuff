1. It should not return a fraction object because it would contradict with the functions that are "constant" and since the 
references would only be temporary it would not work with the functions that were implemented.

2. The temporary objects are Fraction a, b, c, d, e.

3. Simplifications made were pointers that were implemented in the functions, and the overload functions such as the 
operator* were used to simplify the program in general. This would create a more efficient code structure in the process.

4. I learned about overloading operators and how they function in a program properly. I also learned about how fractions 
can be implemented into function programs so different output and values can be displayed as well, which was very
interesting to me.

Quiz 3 Reflection

1. How does the compiler recognize two functions that have been overloaded?
Answer: It recognizes with the data types and number of parameters.

2. What does a C++ reference parameter do?
Answer: It receives the address of the actual parameter, like a c++ object, like a pointer.
