1. Initializing an object's variables in a constructor ensuring that the object has a defined state. Using this method
objects do not break and behave as expected when they are created.

2. I minimized code duplication by creating different functions that would fit accordingly and put them on the header file,
and namespaces were included so that code redundancy would be reduced even further.

3. We created public functions to access the private data. In the header file, the canTravelWith function was placed in
the public function section, so it was able to access private data.

4. We need an if statement for each strcpy so that the entire program can function properly. 

5. I learned about how to use constructors and how they can be implemented in the function. They can be incorporated with 
queries as well which I did not know about at first.
